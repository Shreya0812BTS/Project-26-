Japchae is a very popular Korean dish. It is the number one sought after dish particularly during the Korean festive holidays (e.g. New Yearâ€™s day and Harvest festival) but it is also enjoyed on any other common day as well.
I chose this dish as I like South Korea and it's the favourite dish of my favorite k-pop singer Kim Taehyung.
